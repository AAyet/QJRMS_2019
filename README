AS A RESPONSE TO AN SST FRONT, FROM THE ANALYTICAL 
SOLUTION PRESENTED IN 

A. Ayet and J.L. Redelsperger, QJRMS, 2019
DOI:  https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.3578

(c) A. Ayet, original version of 06/2019

All the programs have been tested Python 2.7.12  with Anaconda 4.2.0 (64-bit).

###################################################
The main folder contains two notebooks 
- 'Figures_notebook' generates the figures of the paper
- '15_notebook' is the equivelent but for the 15 m/s case, not shown in the paper

The /bin folder contains: 

. Anaytical_CTW.py: CTW for "Cold to Warm", is the main file computing the wind in the MABL.
    - this file produces two outputs, saved in /data: wind####.py and N###.pu, which are both used for plots in the notebook

. var_##.py: definition of physical parameters for the analytical model. 
       - var15: contains the 
		parameters used to reproduce the numerical experiment of "Killpatrick et al., J.Climate", with a wind of 15 m/s
       - var5: to reproduce the numerical experiment of Ayet & Redelsperger, 5 m/s

The /data folder contains:

. Outputs of Analytical_CTW.py for two different winds

. Outputs of the numerical simulation with Meso-NH ('EXPER.15' and 'EXPER.5' for the 15 and 5 m/s case respecrively)
